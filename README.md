<h3>1. Middlewares</h3><p> To manage Global state of our React applications and to overcome issues of re-rendering, performance and prop-drilling, one popular solution is <b>Redux</b>.<br /> Redux is a state management library which is an open-source library for managing the application states. Data flows in one direction in Redux. <b>Global Store</b> is the single source of truth for whole application.<br/> Updating Redux store directly from a component is not possible. We dispatch an <b>action</b> which returns an <i>object</i> mentioning what exactly happened. We use a pure <b>reducer</b> function to update redux state accordingly to the <i>action type</i>. <br/>This whole process is synchoronous. We face the issue when we are writing some asynchonous code and want majorely for the cases of api calls in our applications.. <br/>Redux Middleware allows you to intercept every action sent to the reducer so you can make changes to the action or cancel the action.<br/><br/> <h4>Redux Saga -</h4> Here I have attached the basic example of a middleware named <b><i>redux-saga</i></b> for reference. It is the most popular middleware nowadays - <a href ="https://codesandbox.io/s/redux-thunk-basics-with-fetch-api-t31gh3">codesandbox example</a></p>
